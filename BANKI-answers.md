## Behavioral

Most of the behavioral questions should be answered in the CAR format. 
At least three sentences for each question (one for cause, one for action and one for result). 
When answering begin with "At my last opportunity..." or "At my last company". 
Don't sell yourself out and say "bootcamp" or "school".

### CAR

## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [X] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:** Doctype ensures that the browser makes an attempt at following relevant specifications.
  - **Use:** Doctype is used at the beginning of an HTML file.
  - **Example:** The tag for an HTML5 document would be `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype
- [X] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** The lang attribute defines the language on the page or with specific elements.
  - **Use:** I can declare an element and add the lang attribute with its value being the language.
  - **Example:** I can set a specific paragraph's language to French by using the `<p lang="fr">` or set the entire page's language to British English with `<html lang="en-GB">`.
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang
- [X] What kinds of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?
  - **Explanation:** Use lang attribute in your HTML and include the locale in the path. Allow a user to change country/language without hassle. Avoid placing text within an image (translating image text requires separate images). Avoid designs where overflowing text would break the design (tranlsated words may become longer). The design should use color appropriately. Be aware of how countries format dates and currencies. Avoid concatenating translated strings. Be aware of reading direction in other languages (left-to-right / right-to-left)
  - **Source:** https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/html-questions
- [X] What are `data-` attributes good for?
  - **Explanation:** Allows extra information to be stored and exchanged between the HTML and its DOM representation. 
  - **Use:** I have used the `data-*` attribute as part of a `PUT` (& `DELETE`) request in a to-do-list program. 
  A `<span>` element is given an eventlistener and when clicked, it moves up to the parent element and grabs the `data-*` attribute and compares it to the `_id` property within MongoDB.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- todos.ejs -->
  <ul>
    <% todos.forEach( el => { %>
      <!-- Store _id from MongoDB onto data attribute -->
      <li class='todoItem' data-id='<%=el._id%>'>
        <span class='<%= el.completed === true ? 'completed' : 'not'%>'><%= el.todo %></span>
        <span class='del'> Delete </span>
      </li>
    <% }) %>    
  </ul>
  ```
  ```JavaScript
  // main.js - Public
  const todoComplete = document.querySelectorAll('span.completed')
  Array.from(todoItem).forEach((el)=>{
    el.addEventListener('click', markComplete)
  })
  async function markComplete(){
    // const todoId = this.parentNode.childNodes[5].innerText // -> Grabs <span>, moves up to the <li>, moves to a specific node -> Grabs text
    const todoId = this.parentNode.dataset.id // Grabs <span>, moves up to the <li>, searches for _id from EJS & grabs text
    try{
      const response = await fetch('todos/markComplete', {
        method: 'put',
        headers: {'Content-type': 'application/json'},
        body: JSON.stringify({
        'todoIdFromJSFile': todoId
        })
      })
      const data = await response.json()
      console.log(data)
      location.reload()
    }catch(err){
      console.log(err)
    }
  }
  // server.js
  app.use('/todos', todoRoutes)
  // todos.js - Router
  const express = require('express')
  const router = express.Router()
  const todosController = require('../controllers/todos')
  router.get('/', todosController.getTodos)
  router.put('/markComplete', todosController.markComplete)
  // todos.js - Controller
  const Todo = require('../models/Todo')
  module.exports = {
    getTodos: async (req,res)=>{
      try{
        const todoItems = await Todo.find()
        const itemsLeft = await Todo.countDocuments({completed: false})
        res.render('todos.ejs', {todos: todoItems, left: itemsLeft})
      }catch(err){
        console.log(err)
      }
    },
    markComplete: async (req, res)=>{
      try{
        await Todo.findOneAndUpdate({_id:req.body.todoIdFromJSFile},{
          completed: true
          })
          console.log('Marked Complete')
          res.json('Marked Complete')
      }catch(err){
          console.log(err)
      }
    }
  }
  // Todo.js - Model
  const mongoose = require('mongoose')
  const TodoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    todo: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
    completed: {
      type: Boolean,
      required: true,
    }
  })
  module.exports = mongoose.model('Todo', TodoSchema)
  // MongoDB - test database, todos collection
  _id: ObjectId('634498c1a562520b28bd2a98')
  todo: "test"
  completed: false
  __v: 0

- [X] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:** 
  Semantics - Describes content. 
  Connectivity - Communicates with the server.
  Offline and storage - Storing client-side data and operating offline.
  Multimedia - Video & audio.
  2D/3D graphics and effects - A variety of of presentation options.
  Performance and integration - Optimizing speed through usage of computer hardware.
  Device access - Allows usage of various input and output devices.
  Styling - Use of sophisticated themes.

- [X] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:** Local & session storage are web storage objects saved in the browser and are not sent to a server. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in the browser and sent back to a server.
  - **Use:** The web objects saved from local storage doesn't expire & the data from sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Cookies are used in session management, tracking, and personalization. 
  - **Example:** I can set a web storage object using `localStorage.name = John;`, I can get the object using `console.log(localStorage.name);` and remove the object using `delete localStorage.name;`

  - **Source3:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage
- [X] Describe the difference between `<script>, <script async> and <script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:** 
  The `script` tag blocks HTML parsing and resumes after the script is executed. 
  The `script async` tag is fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available.
  The `script defer` tag will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing. 
  - **Use:** 
  The `script async` tag is used when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page.
  The `script defer` tag is used to ensure that the HTML is fully parsed before executing.  
  - **Example:** 
  The `script async` tag can be used for analytic scripts. 
  The `script defer` tag can be used if a script relies on a fully-parsed DOM.

- [X] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:** These unique placements help with the load time of a web page. 
  - **Use:** CSS can be loaded while the the website is being loaded and javascript can only render one file at a time, which may prohibit other files from loading. 
  - **Example:** Placing the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` after the `<title>` element & the `<script src="main.js"></script>` just before the `</body>` closing tag.

- [ ] What is progressive rendering?
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [ ] Why you would use a `srcset` attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [X] Have you used different HTML templating languages before?
  - **Explanation:** Yes, I have used `EJS` in a few of my projects to display variable data from MongoDB.
  - **Use:** I have used the scriplet tag (`<%`) & the plain ending tag (`%>`) to iterate through my collection. I then used both (`<%=`) & (`%>`) tags to output document values.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- index.ejs -->
  <% for(let i = 0; i < quotes.length; i++) {%>
    <li class="quote">
      <span><%= quotes[i].name %></span>
      <span><%= quotes[i].quote %></span>
    </li>
  <% } %>
  ```

### CSS

- [X] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:** Every CSS selector has a specificity weight and selectors with more specificity has priority during cascade rendering.
  - **Use:** When a selector targets an element it holds a weight of 001, when it targets a class it holds a weight of 010, when it targets an ID it holds a weight of 100 and when an element contains !important it holds a weight of 1000,
  - **Example:** `see below` We have a heading element with a class of greet in the HTML and here I am targetting the greet class and changing the text color to green. I am also cascading over the heading element and changing the text color to blue after. The heading text remains green due to higher specificity weight.
  ```HTML
  <h1 class="greet">
  ```
  ```CSS
  .greet {
    color: green;
  }
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

- [X] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:** Every web browser has its default styles and resetting or normalizing CSS ensures cross-browser compatibility. I have mostly used the reset stylesheet and recently combine the reset with a normlaize stylesheet. This approach allowed me to reduce inconsistencies without having to redefine the base-level of styling to elements.
  - **Use:** A reset stylesheet reduces browser inconsistencies and a normalize stylesheet sets element with modern standards.
  - **Example:** `See below:`

`Reset:`
```CSS
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	border: 0;
	font-size: 100%;
	font: inherit;
	vertical-align: baseline;
}
```
`Normalize:`
```CSS
  h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    margin: 0.67em 0;
  }
```

  - **Source3:** https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
- [X] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:** The float property takes an element, removes it from the normal flow of a page, and positions it to the left or right of its parent element.
  - **Use:** A floated element must be contained or cleared and floating an inline level element will convert it to a block level element.
  - **Example:** `see below` The example below removes the anchor from the page and positions it to the left our header. The header's height would collapse without the clearfix class.
  ```HTML
  <header class="clearfix"> 
    <a href="#"></a>
  </header>
  ```
  ```CSS
  a {
    float: left;
  }
  .clearfix:before,
  .clearfix:after {
    content: "";
    `display`: table;
  }
  .clearfix:after {
    clear: both;
  }.clearfix {
    clear: both;
    *zoom: 1;
    }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/#floats
- [X] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:** Elements at the top of the DOM are positioned behind elements coming after them.
  - **Use:** The element with the highest z-index value will appear on top and to use the z-index property, you must first apply a position value of relative, absolute, or fixed. 
  - **Example:** `see below`  The 2nd .box element will appear ontop the 3rd .box element and will overlap the 1st .box element.
  ```CSS
  .container {
    position: absolute;
  }
  .box:nth-child(1) {
    z-index: 1;
  }
  .box:nth-child(2) {
    z-index: 3;
  }
  .box:nth-child(3) {
    z-index: 2;
  }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/detailed-css-positioning/#z-index-property
- [X] Describe BFC (Block Formatting Context) and how it works.
  - **Explanation:** A part of a visual CSS rendering of a web page. It's the region in which the layout of block boxes occurs and in which floats interact with other elements.
  - **Use:** An element that establishes a new block formatting context will contain internal floats, exclude external floats, and suppress margin collapsing.
  - **Example:** A BFC is created by at least one of the following: `see below`
  ```
  - Floats (elements where value isn't `none`.)
  - Display (elements with value of `inline-block`, `flex`, `grid`, & more.)
  - Overflow (elements has a value other than `visible` and `clip`.)
  ```
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context
- [X] What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?
  - **Explanation:** A few techniques used to handle floats are to contain the floated elements within a parent element, using the `clear` property & with the `both` value, and the `.clearfix` hack which does both containing & clearing.
  - **Use:** It is important that `clear` is applied to an element appearing after the floated elements, not before. Containing floats ensures that the styles will be rendered properly. The outcomes of containing floats versus clearing them are nearly the same.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  `Containing floated elements`
  ```HTML
    <header></header>
    <section>
        <article>float left</article>
        <aside>float right</aside>
    </section>
    <footer></footer>
  ```
  ```CSS
  header, section, article, aside, footer {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    border: 2px solid red;
    height: 200px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  section {
    border: 0;
  }
  article {
    width: 50%;
    float: left;
  }
  aside {
    width: 50%;
    float: right;
  }
  ```

  `Clearing an element after floated elements`
  ```HTML
    <header></header>
    <article>float left</article>
    <aside>float right</aside>
    <footer>footer</footer>
  ```
  ```CSS
  header, article, aside, footer {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    border: 2px solid red;
    height: 200px;
    text-align: center;
  }
  footer {
    clear: both;
  }
  article {
    width: 50%;
    float: left;
  }
  aside {
    width: 50%;
    float: right;
  }
  ```

- [X] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:** The practice of using one background image across multiple elements.
  - **Use:** Spriting images cuts the number of HTTP requests made from using multiple images.
  - **Example:** `see below` Take a handful of images, arrange them into a single image, and use the `background-position` property to move through images. 
  ```CSS
  .spanA {
    background-position: 0px;
  }
  .spanB {
    background-position: 16px;
  }
  .spanC {
    background-position: 32px;
  }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/#reduce-http-requests
- [X] How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
  - **Explanation:** Every web browser has its default styles and I would use either a reset or normalize stylesheet to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
  - **Use:** I can use a reset stylesheet to reduce browser inconsistencies or a normalize stylesheet to set elements with modern standards.
  - **Example:** `see below`
`Reset:`
```CSS
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	border: 0;
	font-size: 100%;
	font: inherit;
	vertical-align: baseline;
}
```
`Normalize:`
```CSS
  h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    margin: 0.67em 0;
  }
```

- [ ] How do you serve your pages for feature-constrained browsers? What techniques/processes do you use?
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [X] What are the different ways to visually hide content (and make it available only for screen readers)?
  - **Explanation:** Best practice is to use the global `hidden` boolean attribute, which is available to all elements for use. Another way is to use the `display` property with the `none` value, but it is semantically incorrect. 
  - **Use:** Screen readers will temporarily skip an element that uses the `hidden` attribute. This can be used to hide a success message until an action is completed.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- Semantic -->
  <div hidden>
    <p>Success</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Not semantic-->
  <div class="useDisplay">
    <p>Success</p>
  </div>
  ```
  ```CSS
  .useDisplay {
    display: none;
  }
  ```

- [ ] Have you ever used a grid system, and if so, what do you prefer?
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [X] Have you used or implemented media queries or mobile specific layouts/CSS?
  - **Explanation:** I use media queries in every project I have built so far and I know about the mobile-first approach when building the layout.
  - **Use:** The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.
  - **Example:** `see below` The default style has block elements taking the full width of its container, stacked vertically on one another. The media query activates for wider viewports and reduces the width of the contained elements. It floats each contained element in opposite directions to create a new layout.
  ```HTML
  <div class="clearfix">
    <section></section>
    <aside></aside>
  </div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  section,
  aside {
    background: yellow;
    color: #fff;
    margin: .25rem;
    padding: .5rem;
    text-align: center;

- [X] Are you familiar with styling SVG?
  - **Explanation:** Yes I can use external stylesheets to style an `<svg>` element and use inline CSS to do basic-styling to an attribute.
  - **Use:** SVG-format vector images can be rendered at any size without loss of quality.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- The `d` attribute is styled with inline css -->
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path 
      d="m9.067.43 1.99 4.031c.112.228.33.386.58.422l4.45.647a.772.772 0 0 1 .427 1.316l-3.22 3.138a.773.773

- [X] Can you give an example of an `@media` property other than screen?
  - **Explanation:**The default media type is `screen` and a few other common media types are `all` and `print`.
  - **Use:** `see below`
  The `all` media type is suitable for all devices. 
  The `print` media type is intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode. 
  The `screen` media type is untended primarily for screens.
  - **Example:** `see below` The media query below activates on screens in print preview mode & changes the font-size of text within the `body` tag.
  ```CSS
  @media print {
    body {
      font-size: 10pt;
    }
  }
  ```

- [X] What are the advantages/disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?
  - **Explanation:** Preprocessors help remove inefficiencies and contain ways to build websites easily and logically. Preprocessors have a learning curve with their syntax.
  - **Use:** Haml promotes Do not-Repeat-Yourself (DRY) concepts, well structured markup and make writing code easier. Sass requires less characters and provide a cleaner syntax. SCSS has a more flexible syntax, including the ability to write plain CSS.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```Ruby
  # HAML
  %body
    %header
      %h1 Hello World
    %section
      %p Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
  ```
  ```HTML
  <!-- Compiled HTML -->
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    </section>
  </body>
  ```
  ```Ruby
  # SCSS
  .new {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
    span {
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }
  }

  # SASS
  .new
    color: red
    font-weight: bold
    span
      text-transform: uppercase
  ```
  ```CSS
  /* Compiled CSS */
  .new {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .new span {
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/preprocessors/
- [X] Describe what you like and dislike about the CSS preprocessors you have used.
  - **Explanation:** I like that child-selectors can be nested inside a parent-selector and that Sass can be converted to SCSS and vice versa. I dislike that the command line must be used to compile files for markup & styling.
  - **Use:** When declaring a rule, a parent selector can have declarations and nest a child selector within its declaration block. When compiling a `.scss` or `.sass` file into a `.css` file, a sass command must be called from the command line.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```Ruby
  # Sass command to compile .sass files to a .css file
  sass styles.sass styles.css

  # Command to convert Sass to SCSS
  sass-convert styles.sass styles.scss

  # Command to convert SCSS to Sass
  sass-convert styles.scss styles.sass

  # Nesting child-selectors within a parent-selector
  # SCSS
    .new {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
    span {
      text-transform: uppercase;
    }
  }

  # SASS
  .new
    color: red
    font-weight: bold
    span
      text-transform: uppercase
  ```
  ```CSS
  /* Compiled CSS */
  .new {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  .new span {
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }

- [X] How would you implement a web design comp that uses non-standard fonts?
  - **Explanation:** I use Google Fonts and link the font within my `HTML` to use & render fonts that are not installed on a computer. Another way would be to upload fonts to a server and include them on a website.
  - **Use:** The `font-family` property is used to declare which font should be used to display text.  The `@font-face` at rule can also be used to declare fonts.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- Linking Google Font -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Google fonts -->
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@100&family=Roboto:wght@100;400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  ```
  ```CSS
  /* Declaring a font with font-family rule */
  body {
    font-family: Roboto, 'sans-serif';
  }

  /* Declaring a font with @font-face at-rule */
  @font-face {
    font-family: "Lobster";
    src: local("Lobster"), url("lobster.woff") format("woff");
  }
  body {
    font-family: "Lobster", "sans-serif";
  }
  ```

- [X] Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.
  - **Explanation:** The `key selector` determines which element the styles will be applied to and every selector has a specificity weight which identifies how its styles will be rendered.
  - **Use:** Using combined selectors should be read from right to left and selectors with higher specificity weight has more superiority when a styling conflict occurs.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <section class="container">
    <h2>Hello world</h2>
  </section>
  ```
  ```CSS
  /* h2 is the Key selector & .container is the prequalifier of a combined selector */
  .container h2 {
    color: #fefefe;
    font-family: 'Times New Roman';
  }

  /* section h2 has less specificity weight than .container h2. The styles of section h2 will not be rendered. */
  section h2 {
    color: #000;
  }
  ```

- [X] Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.
  - **Explanation:** A pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that allows a specific part of the selected element(s) to be styled.
  - **Use:** I can target an `input` element's `::placeholder` pseudo-element and change the opacity of the text displayed in the input.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```CSS
  input::placeholder {
    opacity: 0.25;
  }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements 
- [X] Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser, through CSS, to render your layout in different box models.
  - **Explanation&Use:** Every element is a rectangular box and the size of that box is defined by the `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `border`, and `display` properties of an element. The box model is additive by default and using the `box-sizing` property with a `border-box` value renders layouts a non-additive box model.
    - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <div class="withBoxSizing"></div><!--Width = 200pixels (border&padding)-->
  <div class="noBoxSizing"></div><!--Width = 304pixels (Additive border&padding)-->
  ```
  ```CSS
  .withBoxSizing {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  div {
    border: 2px solid red;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    padding: 50px;
  }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/opening-the-box-model/#box-model
- [X] What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?
  - **Explanation:** This declaration alters the box model so that any border or padding property values are included within the width and height of an element. Its advantage allows us to change exactly how the box model works and how an elementâs size is calculated.
  - **Use:** If we set an element's width to be 200 pixels and add 5 pixels of padding, the actual width remains 200 pixels.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <div class="withBoxSizing"></div><!--Width = 200pixels (border&padding)-->
  <div class="noBoxSizing"></div><!--Width = 304pixels (Additive border&padding)-->
  ```
  ```CSS
  .withBoxSizing {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  div {
    border: 2px solid red;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    padding: 50px;
  }
  ```
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/opening-the-box-model/#box-model
- [X] What is the CSS `display` property and can you give a few examples of its use?
  - **Explanation:** How elements are displayed is determined by the `display` property & every element has a display property value.
  - **Use&Examples:** Elements using `display: block` occupy any available width, begin on a new line, and are used in headings and structural elements. 
  Elements using `display: inline` occupy only the width their content requires, line up on the same line, and are used to be bold or italicize words in content.
  Element using `display: inline-block` allows the element to accept all box model properties however, the element will be displayed in line with other elements.
  - **Source:** https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/opening-the-box-model/#how-are-elements-displayed
- [X] What's the difference between `inline` and `inline-block`?
  - **Explanation:** An element displayed as `inline` cannot have a fixed size and only accepts horizontal margins. An element displayed as `inline-block` allows all box model properties such as `height, width, padding, and margins`.
  - **Use:** Elements with either `inline` or `inline-block` can both be used to create horizontal menus.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- Spans are inline by default -->
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Home</span><!--
      --><span>About Us</span><!--
      --><span>Services</span><!--
      --><span>Contact Us</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  <!-- Paragraphs are block by default & display changed to inline-block -->
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Home</p><!--
        --><p>About Us</p><!--
        --><p>Services</p><!--
        --><p>Contact Us</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>    
  ```
  ```CSS
  li {
    margin: 0 5rem;
    list-style: none;
  }
  p {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 0 2rem;
    /* width declaration does apply inline-block */
    width: 500px;
  }
  span {
    margin: 0 2rem;
    /* width declaration does not apply */
    width: 500px;
  }
  ```

- [X] What's the difference between a `relative`, `fixed`, `absolute` and `static` positioned element?
  - **Explanation:**
  `static`: Every element has a position value of static, which exists in the normal flow of a document & doesnât accept box offset properties.
  `relative`: Allows elements to appear within the normal flow a page, moves an element in relation to itself & other elements are not allowed to move into this space.
  `absolute`: Elements will not appear within the normal flow of a document, moves an element in relation to their closest relatively positioned parent element & the original space and position will not be preserved.
  `fixed`: Element will always appear regardless of where a user is on the page, moves an element in relation to the browser viewport, and it does not scroll with the page.
  - **Use:** A `fixed` element can be used to create a fixed header or footer.

- [X] What existing CSS frameworks have you used locally, or in production? How would you change/improve them?
  - **Explanation:** `MaterializeCSS` is the first CSS framework I have used locally and `Bootstrap` is the first CSS framework I've used in production. It would cool if the documentation provided the code to create their components without using the framework.
  - **Use:** Once the packages are installed, the script source and stylesheets are linked, using a component is done by applying a class to an HTML element.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```
  Terminal:
  npm install materialize-css
  ```
  ```HTML
  <!-- Linking stylesheet & script source -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/materialize.min.css"  media="screen,projection"/>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- A button component -->
      <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn">button</a>
      <script type="text/javascript" src="js/materialize.min.js"></script>

- [X] Have you played around with the new CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?
  - **Explanation:** I have used flexbox in projects to vertically or horizontally position elements at the start, middle, or end of a page.
  - **Use:** I use apply the `display: flex` declaration on a parent element, then apply the `justify-content`, `flex-direction`, or `align-items` declarations to move the children elements contained within the parent element.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <div class="container">
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
  </div>
  ```
  ```CSS
  /* Positioning elements in the middle of a page, vertically & horizontally */
  div {
      border: 2px solid red;
      height: 50px;
      width: 100px
  }
  .container {
      height: 500px;
      width: 500px;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
  }

- [X] Can you explain the difference between coding a web site to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?
  - **Explanation:** A responsive website is suitable to work on every device and screen size. The mobile-first strategy is targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows. 
  - **Use:** Both are responsive and the difference is responsive is determined after a website is complete, mobile-first is used while a website is in development. 
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```CSS
  /* mobile first - Default background */
  body {
    background: #ddd;
  }
  /* Background as viewport grows */
  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
      background-image: url("bg.png") 50% 50% no-repeat;

- [X] What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?
  - **Explanation:** `null` & `undefined` are used to denote the absence of a meaningful value. `undeclared` is an improper variable declaration.
  - **Use:** `null` & `undefined` are values and can be checked using the `equality ( == )` or `strict eqaulity ( === )` operator. `undeclared` will throw a ReferenceError. 
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // checking for undefined or null
  const a = undefined;
  const b = null;
  console.log(a === undefined); // true
  console.log(b === null);      // true
  console.log(a == b);          // true
  console.log(a === b);         // false

  // undeclared
  const c = hello;  // ReferenceError: hello is not defined

- [X] Can you describe the main difference between a `.forEach()` loop and a `.map()` loop and why you would pick one versus the other?
  - **Explanation:** 
  A similarity is `.forEach()` and `.map()` both iterate over an array and execute a provided function on every element within the array. 
  The difference is that `forEach()` applies the provided function and does not return anything. `map()` applies the provided function and return a new array of the same size containing the mutated elements. 
  - **Use:** `map()` does not mutate the original array when applying the provided function.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  let arrayOfLetters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
  // Map
  arrayOfLetters.map((element) => element.toUpperCase());                  // Output -> ['A', 'B', 'C']

  // forEach
  arrayOfLetters.forEach((element) => element.toUpperCase());              // Output -> Undefined
  arrayOfLetters.forEach((element) => console.log(element.toUpperCase())); // Output -> 'A' 'B' 'C'
  ```

- [X] What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
  - **Explanation:** I have used anonymous functions with the `event` parameter inside of an `Eventlistener` to access the `keyboardEvent` object.
  - **Use:** I access the `event` object & compare the `key` property-value to the value `"Escape"`. If this statement evaluates as true, I invoke a function that closes the current interface.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  document.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    if (event.key === "Escape") {
      closeModal();
    }
  });

- [X] How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)
  - **Explanation:** I use `seperation of concern` principles and `model-view-controller` architectural patterns to organize my codebase.
  - **Use:** I seperate my HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and do not write CSS in my HTML and vice versa. When creating full-stack applications I seperate functionalities of my application into logical segments. The server-side logic will be in my router & controllers, the storage and database code will be in my model, and front-end related code will be in my views.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- Seperation of concerns -->
  <!-- index.html -->
  <body>
    <h2>Hello world</h2>
  </body>
  ```
  ```CSS
  /* Seperation of concerns */
  /* public/css/styles.css */
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

- [X] Have you ever used JavaScript templating? If so, what libraries have you used?
  - **Explanation:** I have used `EJS`, `Pug`, and `Handlebars` as templating engines for my full stack web applications.
  - **Use:** These templating languages were used to display variable data and dynamically generate content on my web pages.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <!-- EJS -->
  <!-- Dymamically generate content -->
  <% todos.forEach( el => { %>
    <li class='todoItem' data-id='<%=el._id%>'>
      <div class="collapsible-header container">
        <!-- Display variable data -->
        <span class='<%= el.completed === true ? 'completed' : 'not' %> '><%= el.todo %></span>
      </div>
    </li>
  <% }) %>

  <!-- Pug -->
  <!-- Dynamically generate content -->
  tbody
    each user in userInfo
      if user.id == currentUser
    each link,index in urlInfo
      if link.user == user.email
        tr
          td
            <!-- Display variable data -->
            a(href=`${link.slug}` target="_blank" id=`shortLink-${index}`) #{link.slug}

  <!-- Handlebars -->
  <!-- Dynmically generate content -->
  <tbody>
    {{#each stories}}
      <tr>
        <!-- Display variable data -->
        <td><a href="/stories/{{_id}}">{{title}}</a></td>
        <td>{{formatDate createdAt 'MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a'}}</td>

- [X] Explain "hoisting".
  - **Explanation:**  `var` Declarations are processed when the function starts & are defined from the beginning of the function, no matter where the definition is.
  - **Use:** Using `var` can allow code to execute before it is defined.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  function sayHi() {
    // The phrase variable reassigned to contain a string value
    phrase = "Hello";
    // Executes the alert() method to display the value stored in the greet variable
    alert(phrase);
    // The initial declaration of the phrase variable. It is declared after it is used in the alert() method.
    var phrase;
  }
  // Invokes the sayHi() function.
  sayHi();

  - **Explanation:** The equality operator attempts to convert data types then checks values & strict equality operator checks for values & its data type.
  - **Use:** Use strict equality and avoid comparing an object & a primitive with the equality operator, as it will convert the object to a primitive.
  - **Example:** Comparing `'1' == 1` returns true, comparing `'1' === 1` returns false.

- [X] Make this work: `duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5] `
  - **Explanation:** 
  I created a function that takes in 1 parameter. 
  This function will return an array of numbers. 
  As an example, we are given `[1,2,3,4,5]`. This function should return `[1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]`
  In the function below, 
  I declared a variable containing an empty array. This array will store elements from the array argument.
  I iterated through the array argument using the `map()` method and used type coercion on every element in the array argument. 
  I used the `String()` constructor to convert every element from a number to a string.
  I stored every element from the array argument into the variable containing an array.
  I used the `join('')` method to concatenate every element from the array to a string.
  I used the `repeat()` method and specify the amount of copies that duplicate the converted-string & concatenates the string.
  I used the `split('')` method to convert the string back to an array of strings.
  I iterated through the array of strings using the `map()` method and used type coercion on every element in the array argument.
  I used the `Number()` constructor to convert every element from a string to a number.
  - **Use & Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  function duplicate(array) {
    let arrayOfStrings = [];

    array.map((element) => {
      arrayOfStrings.push(String(element));
    })

    return arrayOfStrings.join('').repeat(2).split('').map((element) => Number(element));
  }
  const exampleOne = duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]);
  console.log(exampleOne);
  ```

- [X] Why is it called a ternary expression, what does the word "ternary" indicate?
  - **Explanation:** Ternary means `operating on three values` and it is a logical operator that takes three operands.
  - **Use:** Ternary operators can be used as an alternative to an `if...else` statement.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  function isEven(number) {
    return number % 2 === 0 ? true : false
  }
  const exampleOne = isEven(2);
  const exampleTwo = isEven(3);
  console.log(exampleOne);  // true
  console.log(exampleTwo);  // false

- [X] What is "use strict";? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?
  - **Explanation:** A statement added to the beginning of source code which enables the use of a restricted variant of JavaScript. 
  - **Use:** One advantage is it eliminates silent errors by changing them to throw errors. One disadvantage is it prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  'use strict';
  let mistypeVariable;
  mistypeVarible = 0; // ReferenceError: mistypeVarible is not defined
  console.log(mistypeVariable); // Does not print due to error above
  console.log(mistypeVarible);  // Does not print due to error above
  ```
  ```JavaScript
  let mistypeVariable;
  mistypeVarible = 0; // 0
  console.log(mistypeVariable); // Undefined
  console.log(mistypeVarible);  // 0
  ```

- [X] Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5
  - **Explanation:** I initialize this for loop by declaring a variable named `i` and set its value to `1`. I set the stopping condition when `i` is `less than or equal to 100`. My final expression is to increment the value stored inside of `i` by one on every iteration.
  - **Use:** I start the for loop at 1 because 0 will print `"fizzbuzz"` to the console on the first iteration. The stopping condition is `<= 100` so the loop does not stop when `i = 99`. The final expression increments the value of `i` so I am eventually able to escape this loop and prevent an infinite loop.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if ((i % 3 === 0) && (i % 5 === 0)) {
      console.log("fizzbuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log("fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("buzz");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }

- [X] What are the pros and cons of using Promises instead of callbacks?
  - **Explanation:** Promises allows asynchronous code to be readable like synchronous code and avoids callback hell. Using the `Promise.allSettled` method may require polyfills to support older browsers.
  - **Use:** Promises can be used with the `fetch()` API and resolves when a response is received.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Fetches data from Dog CEO API
  fetch('https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all')
    // Promise resolves when a response is received
    .then(response => {
        return response.json();
    })
    // The response data is rendered into the DOM
    .then(data =>{
        const dataObject= data.message;
        const dataObjectProperties = Object.keys(dataObject);

        for (let i = 0; i < dataObjectProperties.length; i++) {
            const optionTags = document.createElement('option');
            optionTags.innerText = dataObjectProperties[i];

- [X] What tools and techniques do you use debugging JavaScript code?
  - **Explanation & Use:** The `console.log()` method allows me to manage code while writing client or server-side JavaScript. When I run into errors, reading the error will point out where & how the error occurred. Researching the error(s) will usually provide additional insight.  A helpful technique while writing front-end code is to inspect the page, select an element, target the element and edit the styles on dev tools.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  "use strict"
  let mistypeVariable;
  mistypeVarible = 0; // ReferenceError: mistypeVarible is not defined
  console.log(mistypeVariable); // Does not print due to error above
  console.log(mistypeVarible);  // Does not print due to error above
  ```

- [X] What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?
  - **Explanation:** I usually start with `for loops` on my first pass-through over the problem. I will refactor how I iterate over arrays or objects when the solution is clear to me.
  - **Use:** A `for loop` is how I iterate through arrays of primitives. A `for of loop` is how I iterate through an array of objects. If the problem wants the original array to be mutated I will use the `forEach()` method, otherwise `map()` usually is my go-to iterator method after trying a `for loop`. If I need to iterate through an object I will use a `for in loop`. I will use the initialized variable to access properties and use bracket notation to access property-values.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Variables
  let arrayOfNumbers = [2, 3, 4]
  let changeThisArray = [2,4,6,7,5,3,8,1,9]
  let arrayOfUsers = [
    {id: 'john', name: "John Smith", age: 20},
    {id: 'ann', name: "Ann Smith", age: 24},
    {id: 'pete', name: "Pete Peterson", age: 31},
  ];
  let users = [ 
    { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 },
    { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 },
    { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 }
  ];
  let object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
  
  // For loop
  for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfNumbers.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i])
  }

  // forEach (mutates original array)
  console.log(changeThisArray)  // Output -> [2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9]
  function filterRange(array, a, b) {
    array.forEach((element, index) => element >= a && element <= b ? element : array.splice(index, 1))
  }
  filterRange(changeThisArray, 3, 9)
  console.log(changeThisArray)  // Output -> [4, 6, 7, 5, 3, 8, 9]

  // for of loop
  function groupById(array) {
    let emptyObj = {};

    for (const element of array) {
        emptyObj[element.id] = {
            id: element.id,
            name: element.name,
            age: element.age
        }        
    }
    return emptyObj
  }
  const exampleOne = groupById(arrayOfUsers);

- [X] Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.
  - **Explanation:** Synchronous functions complete tasks one after another and if one task stops, the following tasks stop.
  Asynchronous functions complete tasks independent of each other and if one task stops, the following tasks are not affected.
  - **Use:** JavaScript is synchronous and blocking by default and the web APIs or environment are asynchronous.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Function completing tasks synchronously
  function houseOne() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 1');
  }
  function houseTwo() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 2');
  }
  function houseThree() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 3');
  }
  houseOne();
  houseTwo();
  houseThree();
  // Output -> ...house 1, ...house 2, ...house 3

  // Function completing tasks asynchronously
  function houseOne() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 1');
  }
  function houseTwo() {
    setTimeout(() => console.log('Paper delivered to house 2'), 0);
  }
  function houseThree() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 3');
  }
  houseOne();
  houseTwo();
  houseThree();

- [X] What is event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?
  - **Explanation:** JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking synchronous language that contains a call stack, a task queue, and an event loop.
  The call stack is a Last In First Out data structure and the task queue is a First In First Out data structure. 
  The event loop runs tasks in the call stack first and when the stack is empty the event loop picks up tasks from the task queue and moves those tasks to the call stack to be run.

- [X] Explain the differences on the usage of foo between `function foo() {}` and `var foo = function() {}`
  - **Explanation:** The first uses foo as a function declaration and the second uses foo as a function expression. 
  - **Use:** Function declarations may use the hoisting feature in JavaScript, which allows access to function declarations before theyâre defined. Function expressions may omit the function's name & is called an anonymous function. Function expressions may not use the hosting feature.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Function declaration - hoisting feature used
  foo();  // Output -> 'Hello world'

  function foo() {
    return "Hello world";
  }
  ```
  ```JavaScript
  // Function expression - function name omitted
  const bar = function() {
    return "Olleh dlrow";
  }
  bar();  // Output -> 'Olleh dlrow'

- [X] What are the differences between variables created using `let`, `var` or `const`?
  - **Explanation & Use:** `let` & `const` are modern block-scoped variable declarations. `const` variables cannot be redeclared or changed through reassignment. `let` variables can be changed through reassignment. `var` is an "old-school" globally-scoped or function-scoped variable declaration. `var` variables are hoisted, visible through code blocks, and can be redeclared & reassigned.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  if (true) {
    // Hoisted* (Var declared below their use)
    phrase = "Hello";
    // Ignores code blocks**
    phrase2 = "World";
    // Global variable test
    var test = true;
    let test2 = true;
    const test3 = true;
    var phrase; // *Declared after the use
    if (false) {
      var phrase2; // **conditional not true & variable still declared
    }
  }
  console.log(test);  // Output -> true
  console.log(phrase);  // Output -> "Hello"
  console.log(phrase2);  // Output -> "World"
  console.log(test2); // Output -> ReferenceError: test2 is not defined

- [X] Can you give an example for destructuring an object or an array?
  - **Explanation:** Destructuring in JavaScript is a method of extracting multiple properties from an array through assignments.
  - **Use:** Destructuring has made extracting data from an array very simple and readable. Returned arrays can be destructured and destructuring can be used to swap values.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Destructuring an array
  let [first, second, third] = ['Hello', 'world', 'olleh']
  console.log(first)  // Output -> Hello
  console.log(second) // Output -> world
  console.log(third)  // Output -> olleh

  // Destructuring returned array value
  function greetings() {
    return ["Hello", "Hey", "hi"];
  }
  let [a, b, c] = greetings();
  console.log(a); // Output -> Hello
  console.log(b); // Output -> Hey
  console.log(c); // Output -> hi

  // Swapping values with destructuring
  let a, b;
  [a, b] = ["Hello", "World"];
  [a, b] = [b, a];
  console.log(a); // Output -> World
  console.log(b); // Output -> Hello

- [X] ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?
  - **Explanation:** Template literals offer a readable way to perform string interpolation by concatenating expression with placeholders.
  - **Use:** A template string is created by delimiting the string with backtick characters ` (``) `. A template string may contain placeholders, which are embedded expressions delimited by a dollar sign & curly braces ` ${expression} `.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Template literals with placeholders
  function greet(name, age, mood) {
    return `Hello, my name ${name} and I am ${age} year(s) old. I am feeling ${mood} today!`;
  }
  const exampleOne = greet('world', 1, 'jiggy')
  console.log(exampleOne);  // Output -> Hello, my name world and I am 1 year(s) old. I am feeling jiggy today!

  // Concatenating strings with addition operator
  function greet2(name, age, mood) {
    return 'Hello, my name ' + name + ' and I am ' + age + ' year(s) old. I am feeling ' + mood + ' today!';
  }
  const exampleTwo = greet2('world', 1, 'jiggy')
  console.log(exampleTwo);  // Output -> Hello, my name world and I am 1 year(s) old. I am feeling jiggy today!

- [X] What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?
  - **Explanation:** Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.
  - **Use:** Spread & Rest syntax can be used in destructuring arrays.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Rest syntax
  let a, b, rest;
  [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  console.log(a);   // Output -> 1
  console.log(b);   // Output -> 2
  console.log(rest);// Output -> [3, 4, 5]

  // Spread syntax
  let planets = ["Mercury", "Earth", "Venus", "Mars", "Pluto", "Saturn"];
  let [first, second, ...rest] = ["Mercury", "Earth", ...planets, "Saturn"];
  console.log(first);   //Output: Mercury
  console.log(second);  //Output: Earth
  console.log(rest);    //Output: ['Mercury', 'Earth', 'Venus', 'Mars', 'Pluto', 'Saturn', 'Saturn']

- [X] How can you share code between files?
  - **Explanation:** Code that runs in the browser uses `ES6` modules. Modules are defined with an `export` and taken into use with an `import` at the beginning of the file. NodeJS, `require()` is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files.
  - **Use:** I have used `export` & `require` syntax to hide login credentials to my database. 
  - **Example:** `see below` The config.js file is set to be ignored by a `.gitignore` file and exports the secret key within the variable `connectionString`. The server.js file includes this variable by using the `require()` syntax.
  ```JavaScript
  // .gitignore
  config.js

  // Config.js
  exports.connectionString = 'mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<clusername>.abc987.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
  
  // Server.js
  const mongoAtlasLogin = require('./config.js');
  DB_STRING = mongoAtlasLogin.connectionString;

- [X] How do you update NPM to a new version in Node.js?
  - **Explanation:** To update NPM on Windows operating systems, you will need to modify the installation PATH or remove the npm files from the nodejs folder and update NPM using the command `npm install npm@latest`. On Mac or Linux operating systems, you may use the command `npm install -g npm@latest`.
  - **Use:** On Windows, you may need to edit thit the installation PATH, remove a couple files, and copy a `npmrc` file to another location before running the command to update.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```
  // NodeJS folder PATH
  C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs

  // NPM folder
  C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm
  - **Source:** https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm
- [X] Why is Node.js Single-threaded?
  - **Explanation:** Node is single-threaded for async processing and single-threaded async processing allows for performance and scalability.
  - **Use:** The Node JS Processing paradigm is heavily influenced by the JavaScript Event-based model and the JavaScript callback system. 
  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
- [X] Explain callback in Node.js.
  - **Explanation:** A callback function is called after a given task. When you nest a function inside another function as an argument.    
  - **Use:** It allows other code to be run in the meantime and prevents any blocking. Callbacks can break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // The production() function is nested within the order() function. 
  let order = (call_production) => {
    console.log("Order placed. Please call production")
    production(); // Invokes the production() function
  };
  
  let production = () => {
    console.log("Production has started")
  };

  order();        // Invoking the order() function 
  // Output -> Order placed. Please call production
  // output -> Production has started
  ```

  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
- [X] What is callback hell in Node.js?
  - **Explanation:** Callback hell are multiple nested callback functions that are dependent on each other which results in unreadable and unmanageable code.
  - **Use:** Callbacks can break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  let order = (call_production) => {
    console.log("Order placed. Please call production")
    production();
  };
  
  let production = () => {
    setTimeout(()=>{
      console.log("production has started")
      setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log("The fruit has been chopped")
        setTimeout(()=>{
          console.log(`${stocks.liquid[0]} and ${stocks.liquid[1]} Added`)
          setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("start the machine")
            setTimeout(()=>{
              console.log(`Ice cream placed on ${stocks.holder[1]}`)
              setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log(`${stocks.toppings[0]} as toppings`)
                setTimeout(()=>{
                  console.log("serve Ice cream")
                },2000)
              },3000)
            },2000)
          },1000)
        },1000)
      },2000)
    },0000)
  };

- [X] How do you prevent/fix callback hell?
  - **Explanation:** This can be solved by using async/await keywords in an async function, chaining promises, using promise.all() or promise.any().
  - **Use:**  In an async function we can `await fetch` & `await response.json()` or we can use a conditional inside a `.then()` handler and check for that response.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  function time(ms) {

   return new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {

      if(true){
         setTimeout(resolve,ms);
      }

      else{
         reject(console.log("Shop is closed"))
      }
    });
  }
  async function kitchen(){
      try{
    await time(2000)
    console.log(`Fruit was selected`)

    await time(0000)
    console.log("production has started")

    await time(2000)
    console.log("fruit has been chopped")

    await time(1000)
    console.log(`Milk and Creme added`)

    await time(1000)
    console.log("start the machine")

    await time(2000)
    console.log(`ice cream placed on Cone`)

    await time(3000)
    console.log(`Sprinkles as toppings`)

    await time(2000)
    console.log("Serve Ice Cream")
      }

      catch(error){
    console.log("customer left")
      }
  }

- [X] Explain the role of REPL in Node.js.
  - **Explanation:** REPL stands for `Read Eval Print Loop`. It represents a computer environment and is similar to a windows console or Unix/Linux shell.
  - **Use:** Commands are entered into the REPL and the system responds with an output.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  node -v   // Command Input
  8.15.0    // Command Output

  npm -v    // Command Input
  v16.17.0  // Command Output
  ```
  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
- [X] Name the types of API functions in Node.js.
  - **Explanation:** There are Asynchronous non-blocking functions and Synchronous blocking functions.
  - **Use:** All Node.js library APIs are asynchronous and a Node.js-based server never waits for an API to return data. 
  - **Example:** The Node.js serevr moves to the next API after calling, and a notification mechanism from a Node.js event responds to the server for the previous API call.
  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
- [X] What are the functionalities of NPM in Node.js?
  - **Explanation:** The Node Package Manager provides an online repository for Node.js packages & modules. NPM also provides command-line utility that manages Node.js versions, dependencies and installs packages.
  - **Use:** You can browse through packages & modules from the online repositry at `https://www.npmjs.com/` and type commands into the terminal to install the package.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Installing a package
  npm install figlet

  // Viewing versions
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [X] What is Event loop in Node.js work? And How does it work?
  - **Explanation:** Node.js retrieves the incoming requests and adds those to the Event Queue. The requests are then passed one-by-one through the Event Loop. The Event Loop processes simple requests and returns the responses to the corresponding clients.
  - **Use:** The event loop runs tasks in the call stack first and when the stack is empty the event loop picks up tasks from the task queue and moves those tasks to the call stack to be run.
  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
  - **Source:** [Philip Roberts: The Event Loop JSConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
- [X] What is the purpose of `module.exports` in Node.js?
  - **Explanation:** The module.exports object encapsulates all related code into a single unit of code and exported code can be imported into another file.
  - **Use:** Code can be exported with the `module.exports` function and be used in another file by using the `require()` keyword.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // /config/database.js 
  const mongoose = require('mongoose')
  const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
      const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_STRING, {
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        useUnifiedTopology: true,
        useFindAndModify: false,
        useCreateIndex: true
      })
      console.log(`MongoDB Connected: ${conn.connection.host}`)
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err)
      process.exit(1)
    }
  }
  // connectDB function will be exported
  module.exports = connectDB
  
  // server.js
  // connectDB function is imported using the require() keyword
  const connectDB = require('./config/database')
  // Function is invoked within another file.
  connectDB()
  ```

- [X] What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
  - **Explanation:** In an asynchronous system, tasks are completed independently and tasks do not block other tasks from starting or finishing. In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another and the current task must be completed before the next task begins.
  - **Example:** In an synchronous system, all tasks are in the same "lane" and cannot overtake the other. In an asynchronous system, all tasks are in their own "lane" and will finish at their own pace.

- [X] Difference between `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout()`?
  - **Explanation:** `setTimeout` executes code based off a timer and if no timer is provided, a value of 0 is used which executes the code on the next event cycle. `setImmediate` executes a callback immediately after the browser has completed other operations such as events and display updates.
  - **Use:** `setImmediate` can be used to break up long running operations and can be used over `setTimeout(fn, 0)` to execute heavy operations.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Node terminal
  function timeOutVsImmediate() {
    setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
    setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));
  }
  timeOutVsImmediate(); // Output -> Immediate timeout
  ```

  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
- [X] What is `process.nextTick()`?
  - **Explanation:** A tick occurs every time the event loop takes a full trip. `nextTick()` postpones the execution of action until the next pass around the event loop before the next event loop tick starts.
  - **Use:** `nextTick()` is faster than `setTimeout()` with a timer of 0. `nextTick()` executes an action just before the beginning of the next tick and `setTimeout()` executes an action at the end of the next tick.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Node terminal
  function tickVsTimeout() {
    setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
    process.nextTick(() => console.log('tick'));
  }
  tickVsTimeout(); // Output -> tick timeout
  ```
  - **Source:** https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/nodejs-interview-questions
- [X] What is package.json? What is it used for?
  - **Explanation:** It is a configuration file that npm uses to save all project information. This file can be shared with other developers to install required package needed for the project. 
  - **Use:** & **Example:** Typing the command `npm init` will generate the package.json file after answering the prompted questions. Scripts can be added to this file to start a server.

  - **Explanation:** A class that holds all the objects that can emit events.
  - **Use:** Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Node terminal
  const EventEmitter = require('events');
  class MyEmitter extends eventEmitter {}
  const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
  myEmitter.on('event', () => console.log('Event happened'))
  myEmitter.emit('event') // Output -> Event happened -> true

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time ð)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
