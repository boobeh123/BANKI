## Behavioral

Most of the behavioral questions should be answered in the CAR format. 
At least three sentences for each question (one for cause, one for action and one for result). 
When answering begin with "At my last opportunity..." or "At my last company". 
Don't sell yourself out and say "bootcamp" or "school".

### CAR

## Technical Questions

Most of the technical questions should have a three sentence response in the EUE format:

- **Explanation**
- **Use**
- **Example**

### HTML

- [X] What does a doctype do?
  - **Explanation:** Doctype ensures that the browser makes an attempt at following relevant specifications.
  - **Use:** Doctype is used at the beginning of an HTML file.
  - **Example:** The tag for an HTML5 document would be `<!DOCTYPE html>`
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype
- [X] How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - **Explanation:** The lang attribute defines the language on the page or with specific elements.
  - **Use:** I can declare an element and add the lang attribute with its value being the language.
  - **Example:** I can set a specific paragraph's language to French by using the `<p lang="fr">` or set the entire page's language to British English with `<html lang="en-GB">`.
  - **Source:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang
- [ ] What kinds of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?

- [ ] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [ ] Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.
  - **Explanation:** Local & session storage are web storage objects saved in the browser and are not sent to a server. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in the browser and sent back to a server.
  - **Use:** The web objects saved from local storage doesn't expire & the data from sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Cookies are used in session management, tracking, and personalization. 
  - **Example:** I can set a web storage object using `localStorage.name = John;`, I can get the object using `console.log(localStorage.name);` and remove the object using `delete localStorage.name;`
  - **Source1:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
  - **Source2:** https://javascript.info/localstorage
  - **Source3:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage
- [ ] Describe the difference between `<script>, <script async> and <script defer>`.
  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [X] Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s within `<head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
  - **Explanation:** These unique placements help with the load time of a web page. 
  - **Use:** CSS can be loaded while the the website is being loaded and javascript can only render one file at a time, which may prohibit other files from loading. 
  - **Example:** Placing the `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` after the `<title>` element & the `<script src="main.js"></script>` just before the `</body>` closing tag.

### CSS

- [X] What is CSS selector specificity and how does it work?
  - **Explanation:** Every CSS selector has a specificity weight and selectors with more specificity has priority during cascade rendering.
  - **Use:** When a selector targets an element it holds a weight of 001, when it targets a class it holds a weight of 010, when it targets an ID it holds a weight of 100 and when an element contains !important it holds a weight of 1000,
  - **Example:** `see below` We have a heading element with a class of greet in the HTML and here I am targetting the greet class and changing the text color to green. I am also cascading over the heading element and changing the text color to blue after. The heading text remains green due to higher specificity weight.
  ```HTML
  <h1 class="greet">
  ```
  ```CSS
  .greet {
    color: green;
  }
  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

- [X] What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
  - **Explanation:** Every web browser has its default styles and resetting or normalizing CSS ensures cross-browser compatibility. I have mostly used the reset stylesheet and recently combine the reset with a normlaize stylesheet. This approach allowed me to reduce inconsistencies without having to redefine the base-level of styling to elements.
  - **Use:** A reset stylesheet reduces browser inconsistencies and a normalize stylesheet sets element with modern standards.
  - **Example:** `See below:`

`Reset:`
```CSS
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	border: 0;
	font-size: 100%;
	font: inherit;
	vertical-align: baseline;
}
```
`Normalize:`
```CSS
  h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    margin: 0.67em 0;
  }
```

- [X] Describe floats and how they work.
  - **Explanation:** The float property takes an element, removes it from the normal flow of a page, and positions it to the left or right of its parent element.
  - **Use:** A floated element must be contained or cleared and floating an inline level element will convert it to a block level element.
  - **Example:** `see below` The example below removes the anchor from the page and positions it to the left our header. The header's height would collapse without the clearfix class.
  ```HTML
  <header class="clearfix"> 
    <a href="#"></a>
  </header>
  ```
  ```CSS
  a {
    float: left;
  }
  .clearfix:before,
  .clearfix:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
  }
  .clearfix:after {
    clear: both;
  }.clearfix {
    clear: both;
    *zoom: 1;
    }
  ```

- [X] Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.
  - **Explanation:** Elements at the top of the DOM are positioned behind elements coming after them.
  - **Use:** The element with the highest z-index value will appear on top and to use the z-index property, you must first apply a position value of relative, absolute, or fixed. 
  - **Example:** `see below`  The 2nd .box element will appear ontop the 3rd .box element and will overlap the 1st .box element.
  ```CSS
  .container {
    position: absolute;
  }
  .box:nth-child(1) {
    z-index: 1;
  }
  .box:nth-child(2) {
    z-index: 3;
  }
  .box:nth-child(3) {
    z-index: 2;
  }
  ```

- [X] Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.
  - **Explanation:** The practice of using one background image across multiple elements.
  - **Use:** Spriting images cuts the number of HTTP requests made from using multiple images.
  - **Example:** `see below` Take a handful of images, arrange them into a single image, and use the `background-position` property to move through images. 
  ```CSS
  .spanA {
    background-position: 0px;
  }
  .spanB {
    background-position: 16px;
  }
  .spanC {
    background-position: 32px;
  }

  - **Explanation:** A pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that allows a specific part of the selected element(s) to be styled.
  - **Use:** I can target an `input` element's `::placeholder` pseudo-element and change the opacity of the text displayed in the input.
  - **Example:** `see below`

  - **Explanation:**
  - **Use:**
  - **Example:**
  - **Source:**
- [X] What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?
  - **Explanation:** This declaration alters the box model so that any border or padding property values are included within the width and height of an element. Its advantage allows us to change exactly how the box model works and how an element’s size is calculated.
  - **Use:** If we set an element's width to be 200 pixels and add 5 pixels of padding, the actual width remains 200 pixels.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```HTML
  <div class="withBoxSizing"></div><!--Width = 200pixels (border&padding)-->
  <div class="noBoxSizing"></div><!--Width = 304pixels (Additive border&padding)-->
  ```
  ```CSS
  .withBoxSizing {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  div {
    border: 2px solid red;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;

  - **Use & Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  function Person(height) {
    this.height = height;
  }
  let tallHuman = new Person(78);
  let avgHuman = Person(60);
  console.log(tallHuman); // Output -> Person {height: 78}

- [X] Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5
  - **Explanation:** I initialize this for loop by declaring a variable named `i` and set its value to `1`. I set the stopping condition when `i` is `less than or equal to 100`. My final expression is to increment the value stored inside of `i` by one on every iteration.
  - **Use:** I start the for loop at 1 because 0 will print `"fizzbuzz"` to the console on the first iteration. The stopping condition is `<= 100` so the loop does not stop when `i = 99`. The final expression increments the value of `i` so I am eventually able to escape this loop and prevent an infinite loop.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
    if ((i % 3 === 0) && (i % 5 === 0)) {
      console.log("fizzbuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log("fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("buzz");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
  ```

- [X] Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions.
  - **Explanation:** Synchronous functions complete tasks one after another and if one task stops, the following tasks stop.
  Asynchronous functions complete tasks independent of each other and if one task stops, the following tasks are not affected.
  - **Use:** JavaScript is synchronous and blocking by default and the web APIs or environment are asynchronous.
  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Function completing tasks synchronously
  function houseOne() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 1');
  }
  function houseTwo() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 2');
  }
  function houseThree() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 3');
  }
  houseOne();
  houseTwo();
  houseThree();
  // Output -> ...house 1, ...house 2, ...house 3

  // Function completing tasks asynchronously
  function houseOne() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 1');
  }
  function houseTwo() {
    setTimeout(() => console.log('Paper delivered to house 2'), 0);
  }
  function houseThree() {
    console.log('Paper delivered to house 3');
  }
  houseOne();
  houseTwo();
  houseThree();
  // Output -> ...house 1, ...house 3, ...house 2

- [X] What is event loop? What is the difference between call stack and task queue?
  - **Explanation:** JavaScript is a single-threaded, non-blocking synchronous language that contains a call stack, a task queue, and an event loop.
  The call stack is a Last In First Out data structure and the task queue is a First In First Out data structure. 
  The event loop runs tasks in the call stack first and when the stack is empty the event loop picks up tasks from the task queue and moves those tasks to the call stack to be run.

  - **Example:** `see below`
  ```JavaScript
  // Callback function
  const addTwo = num => {
    return num + 2;
  }
  // Higher-order function
  const checkConsistentOutput = (func, val) => {
    let checkA = val + 2;
    let checkB = func(val);
    if (checkA === checkB) {
      return checkB;
    } else {
        return `inconsistent results`;
    }
  }
  console.log(checkConsistentOutput(addTwo, 5));
  console.log(addTwo(5));

6. Do you have any questions or concerns about my qualifications?

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time 😉)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
